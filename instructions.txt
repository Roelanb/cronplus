I want to create a console application in C# that execute certain tasks based on certain conditions.
The possible tasks are:
1. Copy a file
2. Move a file
3. Print a file

These tasks are triggered:
1. When a file is created in a certain folder
2. When a file is renamed in a certain folder
3. At a certain moment in time
4. At a certain interval

The tasks are defined in a config json file


add the code to read the config file, parse the json and start the tasks


Make the print job work as following: montior a file path for files being created. When a file is created, 
print it to the configured printer, and more the printed file to a archive folder. The archive folder should be a monthly folder.
