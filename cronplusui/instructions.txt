to manage the tasks in the cronplusservice, I want to build a UI. The ui shouuld work in linux and windows. What is the best way to do that?

Add a config file to the ui application so we can store configuration info for this app like the default config file to load for the service.


publish both apps in the Publish folder, create a folder for each operating system (linux, windows)
