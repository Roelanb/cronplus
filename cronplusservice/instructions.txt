I want to create a console application in C# that execute certain tasks based on certain conditions.
The possible tasks are:
1. Copy a file
2. Move a file
3. Print a file

These tasks are triggered:
1. When a file is created in a certain folder
2. When a file is renamed in a certain folder
3. At a certain moment in time
4. At a certain interval

The tasks are defined in a config json file


add the code to read the config file, parse the json and start the tasks


Make the print job work as following: montior a file path for files being created. When a file is created, 
print it to the configured printer, and more the printed file to a archive folder. The archive folder should be a monthly folder.


add the config.json as an argument to the program


When printing a PDF in windows, the code uses the print command to print the file.
 But this needs a pdf reader installed. Can we avoid that by using a package ? Use a library that is still maintained and free to use.


 Change the TriggerType to enum, with values: FileCreated, FileRenamed, Time, Interval.

 Check the TaskConfigs for validity, the directory, printer etc should be valid

 Add a TaskLogging model and store the data in SurrealDB. The TaskLogging should keep track of all tasks being triggered, when they are triggered, and the result of the task.

 add a static helper class to dump information to the console. Output the list of configs and their validity into a table.
 use https://github.com/khalidabuhakmeh/ConsoleTables

 In the cronplusservice app, the TaskConfig model is CamelCase, but the data is stored as lowerCamelCase in SurrealDB. Update the model to lowerCamelCase.

 Build a helperclass for filename functions.
 The DestinationFile can use wildcards. In both parts of the filename (before and after the .)
 Wildcards can be * of ?.
 Add a function that translates the source filename to the destination filename, using the wildcards
